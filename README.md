# CreditRiskModeling-GenAI
A DEMO for modeling Credit Risk with GenAI(Generative AI) Empowered
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Credit Risk Model designed to predict the Probability of Default (PD) for borrowers using machine learning techniques. The model integrates GenAI (Generative AI) for feature engineering and model diagnostics to improve accuracy and provide insights into the factors driving credit risk.

##Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with GenAI: Use of GenAI for understanding all features's business sense and correlations between predictors

Feature Engineering with GenAI: Use of GenAI for exploring advanced features to enhance model performance.

Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict the Probability of Default(PD), including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
GenAI Empowered Model Diagnosis: Use of GenAI for evaluating the performance of all ML models

Reporting:Use of GenAI for drafting analysis reports in pdf files.

##Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost
- Tensorflow/keras (for neural networks)
- GenAI (installed via Ollama or another package depending on setup)
- DeepSeek (for model deployment)
- Flask or FastAPI (for serving model predictions via APIs)
