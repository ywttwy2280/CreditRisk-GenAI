Credit Risk Modeling with Generative AI on LendingClub Data
This repository contains a machine learning project that applies Generative AI (GenAI) techniques for credit risk modeling using publicly available data from LendingClub. The objective of this project is to predict the creditworthiness of loan applicants and assess the potential risk of default, using advanced Generative AI models to improve predictive accuracy.

Project Overview
The credit risk model is designed to predict the likelihood of loan default for applicants based on historical loan performance data from LendingClub. By leveraging Generative AI methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and other advanced techniques, the project aims to improve model robustness, simulate synthetic loan applications, and better capture complex relationships in the data.

This approach moves beyond traditional credit risk models by using generative models to enhance data diversity and help simulate new data points, thereby training a more accurate and reliable credit risk assessment tool.

Key Features
Data Source: The model uses LendingClub’s publicly available dataset of loan applications, including applicant financial details, loan terms, and loan outcomes (default or repayment).
Generative AI Models: The project applies cutting-edge generative techniques like GANs and VAEs to model the data distribution and generate synthetic samples for training the credit risk model.
Predictive Credit Risk Assessment: The core objective is to predict whether a loan applicant will default based on financial and personal data.
Synthetic Data Generation: GenAI models simulate new loan applications to improve model generalization and address potential imbalances in the dataset.
Modeling Techniques: Use of deep learning, regularization, and cross-validation techniques to fine-tune the predictive model.
Technologies Used
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): For generating synthetic loan data and improving model generalization.
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): For latent space representation and generating diverse synthetic samples.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks for traditional credit risk prediction.
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for preprocessing and feature engineering.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for building and training the generative models.
Model Evaluation: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and other metrics for performance evaluation.
Model Explanation
The model consists of two main components:

Generative AI Model:

This component uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn the distribution of the LendingClub loan data. The generator in the GAN creates synthetic loan applications, while the discriminator evaluates whether a sample is real or fake. Over time, this process helps the model generate high-quality synthetic data that is similar to the original.
The latent space learned by VAEs is used to generate new loan applications, enriching the dataset and improving the diversity of training samples. This is especially useful in scenarios with imbalanced data or when there’s a need for more samples from underrepresented categories (e.g., risky loans).
Credit Risk Prediction Model:

Once the generative model is trained, the synthetic data is combined with the real data to train the credit risk prediction model. This model predicts the probability of a loan default based on applicant features such as:
Applicant credit score
Annual income
Loan amount
Debt-to-income ratio
Term of the loan
Loan grade
Employment length
The output of this model is a probability score indicating the likelihood of a loan default.
By using generative models, this approach helps to better handle class imbalances (e.g., when defaults are much rarer than non-defaults), data scarcity, and complex interactions between features.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project is the LendingClub dataset, which includes the following key columns:

loan_amnt: The loan amount requested.
term: Term of the loan (36 months or 60 months).
int_rate: Interest rate on the loan.
grade: LendingClub's loan grade assigned (A, B, C, etc.).
annual_inc: Annual income of the borrower.
dti: Debt-to-income ratio.
fico_range_high: Highest FICO score of the borrower.
fico_range_low: Lowest FICO score of the borrower.
purpose: The purpose of the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card, etc.).
emp_length: Length of employment (in years).
home_ownership: Whether the borrower owns a home or rents.
loan_status: The target variable, indicating whether the loan was paid off or defaulted.
